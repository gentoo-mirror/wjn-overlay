# ChangeLog for x11-misc/screengrab

# (auto-generated from git log)

  04 Feb 2016; wjn <wjn@aol.jp> metadata.xml, screengrab-2.9999.ebuild:
  Drop IUSE="qxt"

   Though "-DSG_USE_SYSTEM_QXT" remains in upstream, it's broken
  because x11-libs/libqxt doesn't support modern Qt libraries.
  It should not be used.
   'LIBQXT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED' ( https://bitbucket.org/libqxt/libqxt ).

   And "-DSG_GLOBALSHORTCUTS" doesn't work without "-DSG_USE_SYSTEM_QXT".
  It depends on "#include <QxtCore/qxtglobal.h>".

   Thus, these upstream's features don't work.
    - DSG_GLOBALSHORTCUTS
      + Enable global shortcuts for main actions to create screenshots.
    - DSG_USE_SYSTEM_QXT
      + Use system version Qxt Library for global shortcuts.
