*qscintilla-2.9.1-r200 (04 Feb 2016)

  04 Feb 2016; wjn <wjn@aol.jp> +files/qscintilla-qt5.patch, +metadata.xml,
  +qscintilla-2.9.1-r200.ebuild:
  Add newly, version 2.9.1-r200:5 for Qt5

   QScintilla can build for Qt5 as well as Qt4.

   Now app-editors/juffed is going to port to Qt5,
  and it depends on Qt5-based QScintilla.
   See https://github.com/Mezomish/juffed/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt

   But gentoo repository doesn't support Qscintilla based on Qt5.

   This ebuild file makes Qt5-based build.
  To avoid conflicts, libraries for Qt5 are renamed
  (libraries for Qt4 are as-is).
