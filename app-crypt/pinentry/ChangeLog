*pinentry-0.9.6-r1 (15 Sep 2015)

  15 Sep 2015; wjn <wjn@aol.jp> +files/pinentry-0.9.6-qt4.diff,
  -pinentry-0.9.6.ebuild, +pinentry-0.9.6-r1.ebuild:
  Modify to make correct support for Qt4 or Qt5.

   Its configure prefers Qt5.
  If Qt5 is not installed and Qt4 is installed,
  it fallbacks to Qt4 support.

   But if (deps) qtcore:5 is installed and qtgui:5 or qtwidgets:5 is not,
  something weird occurs, including headers fails.
  so compilation fails.

   DEPEND="qt4? ( dev-qt/qtcore:4 dev-qt/qtgui:4 )
          qt5? ( dev-qt/qtcore:5 dev-qt/qtgui:5 dev-qt/qtwidgets:5 )"
  is needed.

   I fixed it by this commit.

   I have already reported gentoo bugzilla,
  it will be fixed in gentoo repository.

*pinentry-0.9.6 (15 Sep 2015)

  15 Sep 2015; wjn <wjn@aol.jp> +files/pinentry-0.8.2-ncurses.patch,
  +files/pinentry-0.8.2-texi.patch, +files/pinentry-0.9.0-accessibility.patch,
  +files/pinentry-0.9.5-build.patch, +metadata.xml, +pinentry-0.9.6.ebuild:
  Add version 0.9.6

   Because pinentry-0.9.6.ebuild in gentoo repository has a bug,
  I added my ebuild.
   I already reported the bug, It will be fixed.

   Also, I added Qt5 support to mine.
  And I changed IUSE, please ensure.
  ( Upstream supports Qt5 newly, and changes configure options. )
