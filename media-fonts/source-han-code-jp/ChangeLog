  25 Nov 2015; wjn <wjn@aol.jp> source-han-code-jp-1.004.ebuild:
  media-fonts/*: Add "mirror" to ${RESTRICT}

   Because they are not uploaded in GENTOO_MIRRORS.

  09 Sep 2015; wjn <wjn@aol.jp> +metadata.xml:
  Add minimal metadata.xml(s) for QA.

  09 Sep 2015; wjn <wjn@aol.jp> source-han-code-jp-1.004.ebuild:
  Update ebuild file format from "# $Header: $" to "# $Id"

   Since Gentoo changes the VCS from CVS to git, ebuild header is changed.

*source-han-code-jp-1.004 (20 Jun 2015)

  20 Jun 2015; wjn <wjn@aol.jp> -source-han-code-jp-1.002r.ebuild,
  +source-han-code-jp-1.004.ebuild:
  Add version 1.004, delete old 1.002R.

    Upstream's release note:
   https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-code-jp/blob/1.004R/relnotes.txt

    Removed "R" from ${PV},
   because "R" in version number means "Release".
    (For your info.: tarballs without "R" contain source codes to make fonts.)

*source-han-code-jp-1.002r (15 Jun 2015)

  15 Jun 2015; wjn <wjn@aol.jp> +source-han-code-jp-1.002r.ebuild:
  Add newly.

    "Source Han Code JP" is based on "Source Han Sans",
   but its Latin letters are replaced to fixed-width ones
   which come from "Source code Pro".

    This font is Japanese (JA) only.
   And it will be displayed as "源ノ角ゴシック Code JP" in the fonts list,
   because Japanese part of "Source Han Sans" is also called "源ノ角ゴシック".

    It is created mainly for program-coding, like such as "Ricty", you know.
